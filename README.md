# gen-fuzz

//future todos
//TODO:
// 1. Not all inputs should be generated by gofuzz, let user to define some of them: check
// 2. Also need to let users take care of the return value of the fuzz function: check
// 3. Automatically run go-fuzz on the generated file (need to go-fuzz-build first)
// 4. *Support fuzz for multiple functions.(/fuzz1/fuzz.go, /fuzz2/fuzz.go, fuzz1...N are separate fuzz units for different target functions)
// 5. Automatically generate unit test from the inputs that made the function crush. (not really, because most likely there are already unit tests)]
